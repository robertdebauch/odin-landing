Practical assignment within the course from the Odin Project

The goal of this project is to practice the skills i have obtain during the Flexbox Section in the Odin Course. 

My personal goal is to try and do it by myself as much as i can, but i will use my notes and google some advices if i will stuck.

The picture i used is in hero-section is my own work. You can use it, if you like it, but please don't forget to mention me (as Nikita Ershov) when you do it.

I have completed the task. To me it's seems ok, but, of course, the website doesn't have good responsive function, which wasn't needed in this practice.

In the next steps i would like to now how to better control text layouts when we deal with smaller screens.
